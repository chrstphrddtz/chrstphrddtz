# About Me

Hey there, I'm Christoph!
<br><br>
Fullstack Web Developer with a strong background in account management. My experience has shaped me into a problem-solver who is dedicated to achieving success through effective communication.
<br><br>
I recently graduated from Spiced Academy in Berlin, where I was learning about Full Stack Web Development, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Next.js. I'm deeply passionate about creating visually stunning and highly functional web applications.
<br><br>
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the bouldering gym or seeking out new sources of inspiration around the city. I'm all about creative problem-solving and finding innovative ways to create unforgettable user experiences.
