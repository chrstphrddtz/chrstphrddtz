# About Me

Hey there, I'm Christoph!
<br>
I'm 34-year-old web developer in the making.
<br>
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the bouldering gym or seeking out new sources of inspiration around the city. I'm all about creative problem-solving and finding innovative ways to create unforgettable user experiences.

Thanks for stopping by my portfolio page - let's work together and make something awesome!
