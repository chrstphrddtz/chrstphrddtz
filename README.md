# About Me

Hey there, I'm Christoph!
<br>
Fullstack Web Developer with a strong background in account management. My experience has shaped me into a problem-solver who is dedicated to achieving success through effective communication.
<br>
Currently, I'm enrolled in the Spiced Academy in Berlin, where I'm learning about Full Stack Web Development, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Next.js. I'm deeply passionate about creating visually stunning and highly functional web applications.
<br>
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the bouldering gym or seeking out new sources of inspiration around the city. I'm all about creative problem-solving and finding innovative ways to create unforgettable user experiences.
