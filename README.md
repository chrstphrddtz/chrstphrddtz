# About Me

Hey there, I'm Christoph!
I'm 34-year-old web developer in the making.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the bouldering gym or seeking out new sources of inspiration around the city. I'm all about creative problem-solving and finding innovative ways to create unforgettable user experiences.
Thanks for stopping by my portfolio page - let's work together and make something awesome!
